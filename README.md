# [DigiPixel](http://http://www.bradsprojects.com/the-digipixel/) - The DigiPixel

The DigiPixel is an open source Arduino and Digispark compatible shield with a 64 pixel RGB LED display and six buttons. The DigiPixel comes with it’s own Arduino library, graphic converter and demo sketches (as seen in the video) to help you get started with making your own DigiPixel creations.

## So what sort of things could I make with the DigiPixel?

Well, it’s really up to your imagination! You could make a game of Space Invaders, Tetris or perhaps Snake. You could write messages in the air and capture it on your camera with the AirWrite function. You could keep track of Facebook likes, use it as an electronic dice, a scrolling desk clock or even a digital name badge. It’s amazing what you can do with just 64 pixels!

## For contributors

If you want to help and provide new samples, improvements or bugfixes, you can via github.

In general, fork the project, create a branch for a specific change and send a
pull request for that branch. Don't mix unrelated changes. You can use the commit
message as the description for the pull request.

## Using the DigiPixel Library

The DigiPixel comes with a Arduino library that you can Import into your envionment.

You can find general instructions here, http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries, generally speaking
you need to **import libraries/DigiPixel** into your Arduino IDE, this will compile the library and make it available to the 
included sample programs.
